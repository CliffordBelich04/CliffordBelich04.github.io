# First Half 
I am starting this documentaion by stating that I immediately have to lower the scope of this project. By this point, I was hoping to be able to add the click and drag movement feature, as well as placing the points (stars) in seemingly random positions.

As of right now, I only have a handful of functioning points, all lined up next to each other. A large portion of why this is taking so long is that there aren't great resources for specifically making a website that you can click and drag to move around within, only resources for dragging objects. 
At the very least I would like to get 2 major steps done by the end of break: Text that appears when each star is hovered over, and some kind of movement feature for locating each star, utilizing click and drag.

I think my next step is to look into how I can utilize threejs and some of the add-ons in relation to it. I should be able to find a website on their example page and reference that code, especially for the click and drag movement, but implementing that may require me to include the implementaion of the rotating sphere. 

As of right now, adding in details isn't as much of a priority as getting the functions of the website to operate correctly. Adding the points should be the easiest aspect, just the features for each one will be the time consuming part. 

I also do not project to have full graphics for points that link to that. Instead, I will use one image / video for now, and have multiple stars link to that same page to conserve on file sizes.
Lastly, adding audio to certain links should be simple, as I have more than enough pieces / sound design sessions that I can use for audio. 

## COMPLETED FEATURES

- Text will appear when a point is hovered over (not stylized)
- Points have operational links (when link is applied)
- Hue can be changed per point

## INCOMPLETE FEATURES

- Glow around each point
- Point positions are static, need to be "random"
- MOVEMENT FEATURE 
- The Sphere


Overall, I do not project this website to be a fully-fledged repository by the deadline; rather a skeleton that I can build up from while I develop my audiovisual / narrative project further.
